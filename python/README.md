## How to improve/learn Python skills:
Documentation has too many jargons. You should follow this path that I have listed below. Consult documentation when in doubt. 

1. Read the Zen of Python
On the python interpreter do the following:
```python
>>> import this
```

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea – let’s do more of those!
```

2. Watch the lecture on "Transforming Code into Beautiful Idiomatic Python" by Raymond Hettinger.

My notes on [Transforming Code into Beautiful Idiomatic Python ](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alvinctk/Python-Talks/blob/master/Transforming-Code-into-Beautiful-Idiomatic-Python/Transforming%20Code%20into%20Beautiful%20Idiomatic%20Python.ipynb)
Common examples on transforming code into idiomatic Python.

3. Read [Google Python Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). Great with examples on what not to do (cons or bad) and what to do (pros or good). 


4. Read [Python Official PEP 8 Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

5. Read [Python Official Tutorial by Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
. You can select specific version. 

6. Supplement [Google For Education - Python](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)
