## Present Your Solution

1. Document what you have done.

2. Create a nice presentation.

- Make sure you highlight the big picture first.

3. Explain why your solution achieves the business objective.

4. Don’t forget to present interesting points you noticed along the way.

- Describe what worked and what did not.
- List your assumptions and your system’s limitations.

5. Ensure your key findings are communicated through beautiful visualizations or easy-to-remember statements (e.g., “the median income is the number-one predictor of housing prices”).
