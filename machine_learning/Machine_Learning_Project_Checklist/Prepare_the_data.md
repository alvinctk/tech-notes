## Prepare the Data 

Notes: 

- Work on copies of the data (keep the original dataset intact)

- Write functions for all data transformations you apply, for five reasons: 
    - You can easily prepare the data the next time
    - You can apply these transformations in future projects
    - To clean and prepare the test set
    - To make it easy to treat your preparation choices as hyperparameters

1. Data cleaning

- Fix or remove outliers (optional).

- Fill in missing values (e.g. with zero, mean, median...) or drop their rows
  (or columns).

2. Feature selection 
    
- Drop attributes that provide no useful information for the task 

3. Feature engineering, where appropriate:

- Discretize continuous features

- Decompose features (e.g., categorical, date/time, etc.). 

- Add promising transformations of features (e.g., log(x), sqrt(x), x^2, etc.).

- Aggregate features into promising new features.

4. Feature scaling:

- Standarlize or normalize features.
